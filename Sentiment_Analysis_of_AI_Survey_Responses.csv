0,2024,The use of LLM has been helpful but also lackluster as sometimes the LLM model is not structured to assist with certain things that I would need to be fixed.,0.15714285714285714,0.3857142857142857
1,2024,Jupiter AI was unhelpful because it did not work. chatgpt was slightly helpful but it would be bad if I became too reliant on it,-0.43333333333333324,0.41666666666666663

4,2024,"It has helped a lot, I actually think more time allotted to AI coding assistance would have been an efficient use of time and would allow for less time to be focused on Pandas/NumPy/Xarray",0.11111111111111112,0.2222222222222222

8,2024,"Negatively, it does not really help me much when I am learning extremely hard codes, and the AI gives me complicated results, but the rest is positive for basic simple code.",-0.09554924242424243,0.4211580086580087
9,2024,"I used ChatGPT a lot in this course. I am disappointed that Jupyter AI did not work as well for me. I feel like while I am using ChatGPT I am not learning as much as I could, so I wish I had a stronger foundation without it instead of heavily relying on it.",-0.25,0.48333333333333334

12,2025,"It definitely helped as a resource. If I couldn't get something right - it was very helpful in working through it with me. Also, when it came to more complicated tasks AI was able to handle them quickly - there was some coding that would have taken me weeks to figure out that AI did in no time.",0.18843537414965986,0.5658163265306122
13,2025,I think it helped when stuck and made sure I was able to get assignments done but sometimes the code given by AI was much different than what we learned in class so it could be hard to follow.,0.17708333333333331,0.6638888888888889
14,2025,"It has helped positively. I am able to solve problems and become much more efficient at solving errors rather than spending hours on trying to figure out which small typo is preventing code from working. Negative impacts could be too much reliance; however, I really only use AI to learn, so I find it beneficial especially off campus when I am solving problems on my own and have questions.",0.15625,0.640625

18,2025,"AI integration actually has helped me to learn the coding topics a lot better and has helped me understand and implement proper etiquette for coding. I think however, that sometimes I rely a little too much on it sometimes, and I would have to go back and make changes that had to be done.",0.08541666666666665,0.2333333333333333

20,2025,"I haven't found a topic where AI is as useful as coding. Of course I've tried it with other subjects, but coding is clearly where it strives. I also found that something I had previously neglected but used extensively since the start of this class was the search feature. Being able to find articles that are relevant to precisely what I need is an amazing tool that search engines are less consistent with.",0.19015151515151515,0.43636363636363634
21,2025,"It allowed me to develop code and ideas far beyond my abilities, while providing documentation to let me go through it and understand what it was saying. It was very helpful and can help put my thought to code.",0.15000000000000002,0.65
22,2025,It has had a positive impact on my education mainly by being able to identify issues that I was unable to see in my codes.,0.09848484848484848,0.5009469696969697
23,2025,I used it mostly because I had fallen behind. I prefer not to use it because I believe the more I use it the more I will rely on it and that reliance will undermine my core understanding of the lesson material.,0.275,0.55
