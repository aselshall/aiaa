"""The use of LLM has been helpful but also lackluster as sometimes the LLM model is not structured to assist with certain things that I would need to be fixed."" (2024)",2024,,,,X,,,,,,X
"""Jupiter AI was unhelpful because it did not work. chatgpt was slightly helpful but it would be bad if I became too reliant on it"" (2024)",2024,,X,,X,,,,,X,
"""It helped me dive into the errors and understand why I was getting them and how to fix them."" (2024)",2024,,,,,,X,,,,
"""It has positively impacted learning by helping me diagnose errors when other resources, such as stack exchange and github forums, are unclear."" (2024)",2024,,,,,,X,,,,
"""It has helped a lot, I actually think more time allotted to AI coding assistance would have been an efficient use of time and would allow for less time to be focused on Pandas/NumPy/Xarray"" (2024)",2024,,,X,X,,,,,,
"""AI coding assistance has helped me build the skeleton of my project and assisted me during homework problems."" (2024)",2024,,,,X,,,X,,,
"""It was good to me! I like having a back up help when I can not resolve problems."" (2024)",2024,,,,X,,,,,,
"""Helped."" (2024)",2024,,,,X,,,,,,
"""Negatively, it does not really help me much when I am learning extremely hard codes, and the AI gives me complicated results, but the rest is positive for basic simple code."" (2024)",2024,,,,,,,,X,,X
"""I used ChatGPT a lot in this course. I am disappointed that Jupyter AI did not work as well for me. I feel like while I am using ChatGPT I am not learning as much as I could...heavily relying on it."" (2024)",2024,,X,,X,,,,,X,
"""It has allowed me to understand topics without seeking assistance first."" (2024)",2024,,,,,X,,,,,
"""I believe it helps me solve problems and makes the class seem more helpful, instead of learning to pass a test we are actually learning to solve problems."" (2024)",2024,,,,X,X,,,,,
"""It definitely helped as a resource...when it came to more complicated tasks AI was able to handle them quickly - there was some coding that would have taken me weeks to figure out that AI did in no time."" (2025)",2025,,,X,X,,,,,,
"""I think it helped when stuck...but sometimes the code given by AI was much different than what we learned in class so it could be hard to follow."" (2025)",2025,,,,X,,,,X,,
"""It has helped positively...become much more efficient at solving errors...Negative impacts could be too much reliance...beneficial especially off campus when I am solving problems on my own..."" (2025)",2025,,X,X,X,X,X,,,,
"""It helped me better understand the topics taught in class"" (2025)",2025,,,,X,X,,,,,
"""It's made me feel more comfortable with coding and understanding data"" (2025)",2025,,,,X,X,,,,,
"""Helped me, yet causes me to overly rely."" (2025)",2025,,X,,X,,,,,,
"""AI integration actually has helped me to learn the coding topics a lot better...I think however, that sometimes I rely a little too much on it sometimes..."" (2025)",2025,,X,,X,X,,,,,
"""It has helped immensely, when I get stuck I am able to figure it out with AI and learn rather than getting frustrated."" (2025)",2025,,,,X,X,X,,,,
"""I haven't found a topic where AI is as useful as coding...Being able to find articles that are relevant to precisely what I need is an amazing tool that search engines are less consistent with."" (2025)",2025,,,,X,X,,X,,,
"""It allowed me to develop code and ideas far beyond my abilities, while providing documentation to let me go through it and understand what it was saying. It was very helpful and can help put my thought to code."" (2025)",2025,,,,X,X,,X,,,
"""It has had a positive impact on my education mainly by being able to identify issues that I was unable to see in my codes."" (2025)",2025,,,,X,,X,,,,
"""I used it mostly because I had fallen behind. I prefer not to use it because I believe the more I use it the more I will rely on it and that reliance will undermine my core understanding..."" (2025)",2025,X,X,X,,,,,,,
"""I think that if you immerse yourself and want to learn coding you will learn it, if you have little to no interest in it you will scoot by using AI and not learn that much"" (2025)",2025,X,,,,X,,,,,
